Russian checkers with optimized A.I using Java and Swing


This is the final version of my HaKfar HaYarok College summary project.
## The A.I
The A.I is implemented via Minimax, with original optimizations staring an In-place(!) recursive call,
which significantly improves both time and space complexity.
The Program can calculate 9 moves deep in a reasonable time.

## Additional Features
* A 2-player local game mode
* Difficulty level of the A.I can be customized (by changing the recursion depth)
* Dimensions of the board (including number of pawn rows) also can be modified by the users

## Thanks
Thanks to my friends and teachers at the HaKfar HaYarok College for providing company and advice.

## More Details
Take a look at the book added to the repo!

I'm happy that the project serves a greater role than my final grade :)
